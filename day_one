Keynote: Finding Purpose in Open Source through Community Building

Got into open source via Django Girls

Speaker was able to mentor someone by slowly giving them Pyladies tasking.

Gives more examples of mentoring where she shows that she tailored her mentoring to the person's needs and strengths. Sometimes she holds their hand more and other times gives more independance. Also shows how folks don't have to be engineers to contribute to Django/open source.

Speaker also talks about how each person brings unique and useful skills to the efforts.

Challenges
- need to find opportunities for junior devs
- it can be key to pay open source contributors
- finding resources for the Django Girls/PyLadies Ghana
- travel and visas - the paperwork can make it hard for folks to contribute and attend conferences if they are coming from around the world.

HTML-ivating your Django web app's experience with HTMX, AlpineJS, and streaming HTML.

Usually you're going to a SPA - Single Page Application

There is a concern about the overuse of the SPA pattern

SPAs are increasing complexity - perhaps without analysis

5 Components to make a great experience
- remove whole-page refreshes from every interactoin
- use small payloads from server to update interface
- update HTML as result of changes in data
- empower rich on-page interactoins
- be fast

HTMX plus AlpineJS - this gives the experience of a SPA Application

You can use HTML attributes to control the behavior which gives you the benefit of locality

also gives much faster rendering time compared to SPA application

SPA applications have much longer times to boot up - and percieved speed is important to users/customers

Dango 4.2 allows for StreamingHttpResponses

Need to split template into pieces and yield each part- speeds up rendering and also gives small areas for replacing - rather than the whole page
