Or the task commit can fail, too

Postgres Performance: From Slow to Pro

RAM is a big issue

you cna use pgtune to get recc settings

not using statement timeouts can cause issues, too

keep an eye on IOPS

remember to do vacuums

a single record result should returnin 1ms

Nothing should take more than 5 seconds to return

-----------

Empathetic testing: Developing with compassion and humility.


switched to ipmp and ppmp in numpy and their test stopped passing

git blame to find out who wrote these tests

They needed to upgrade Python

When they fix the app the test breaks and vice versa

Problem is Implementation Bias - it's testing the way it was built, not the way it works.

Need to write better tests

things change so you have to treat your code as discardable
